# Werewolf
This is a discord bot that narrates a game of real time werewolf, werewolf with a day/night cycle spanning 24 hours, giving an interesting twist on werewolf. The bot can narrate on its own without any input from anyone that's not playing the game. How to use the bot and how to play the game is better seen in the how to play guide found [here](./how-to-play.md)


### After bot invite
Once the bot is on your server and running, you will see a bot-admin channel. This is how you control the bot and manage the server.

## Set up after invitation.
To get the server to have the appropriate roles and channels, please run the following command.
!addroles (This will add the dead, alive, playing, notplaying roles)
!addchannels (Adds the town category as well as all channels for werewolf)

After that, you can use the command to !startgame. More of how that works can be found in [how to play](./how-to-play.md)
