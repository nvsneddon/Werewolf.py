# werewolf
This is like the werewolf bot I built for discord, except more modular and open source. 
The point of this project is to open source the werewolf bot and make it available to the world.

In this project, you will see a discord-config_example.json file. This is just an example file for how the discord-config.json file should look like.
You can rename that file to config.json and replace the fields with your configurations. For example, to get the discord bot working, you will need to set up your own bot at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/. Create an application and then build the bot. 

On the bot page of the application you just built, you have a token that you can copy. That you will need to paste that into the token quotations in discord-config.json.
