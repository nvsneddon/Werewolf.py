## How to use the narrator
The prefix of the narrator is ! for every other command. 
To get help, simply type !help or !help command for help on a specific command. 

More on how to use the narrator will be given with how to play.

## How to play

If you don't know how to play werewolf, you can go to this [link](https://www.playwerewolf.co/rules) to get the basic idea of how to play the game.
This version of werewolf runs a bit differently, as the daytime/nighttime cycle takes 24 hours, making this a more realistic feeling version of werewolf.

To use the narrator, you can invoke the bot using the ! prefix. Try out using !ping and see it give you a response. 

### Playing the game
To play a round, please mark yourself as playing using the !playing command. You can be sure that you're playing when the narrator tells you that you're playing
and when your names turns yellow. When the game starts, you'll get a DM stating what your role is and what your objective is. 

### Roles of werewolf

##### Villager
Villagers are normal everyday people with no special ability.

##### Werewolves
Werewolves pretend to be villagers, but they discuss in the #werewolves channel whom they should kill at night. They can use the !kill command to kill anyone.
If they want to kill John doe with the discord name jdoe#2521 and the nickname John, they can either type jdoe, jdoe#2521, or John. Mentioning people is hard as they cannot be mentioned in a channel that they don't have access to.
The bot is not case sensitive, so !kill John and !kill john will kill the same person.

##### Seer
The seer can investigate someone once per night by using the !investigate commmand. They can either use the discord user name with or without the discriminator, or use the nickname. 

##### Bodyguard
Once per day/night cycle, the bodyguard can protect someone using !protect person. The power restarts every time day starts and can only be used once during that cycle.

##### Cupid/Lovebirds
Cupid has the power to make two people fall in love using !match person1 person2. Once those people are in love, their fates are tied together. 
If one of them dies, so will the other. The lovebirds won't know who set them up and will try to be the last two people alive in the game.

##### Hunter
The hunter is an ordinary villager with a killer final shot. Once the hunter dies, the hunter will be able to shoot any person they desires using the !shoot person command.
The hunter does not have their own channel. They shoot their target in town square and publically announce who they shoot. 

##### Baker
The baker has no special ability but instead devotes their time to baking delicious bread for everyone. Once the baker dies, people will start dying of starvation (unless they're a werewolf because they eat humans).
Every day, up to three villagers will die of starvation until the werewolves win. If you're the baker, do your best not to get killed.

##### Masons
The masons are a secret group of people that know who each other are. They know that they aren't masons, so you can trust them (unless one of them is in love with a werewolf). 
They also receive messages from the dead every night. These are one worded clues that can help the masons. However, the dead werewolves can also send a message, so the masons have to find out what message is trustworthy
and which message isn't. 

##### Dead people
Even if you're dead, you're still in the game. You can see everything happening, but you can't interact directly with any of the game channels. 
You have a goal to help the masons get closer to know who the werewolf is. You can send them a message every night. Dead werewolves can also send one message every night
to try and throw the masons off. These messages can be sent in the afterlife channel using the !sendmessage command. You can send a message with the word short as follows:
!sendmessage short
The masons can get up to two messages per night, one from the dead werewolves and one from the dead masons.  

### Win conditions
There are three win conditions
* Werewolves win when there are more werewolves than villagers. Note that 4 villagers to 4 werewolves doesn't yet secure a win for the werewolves.
* Villagers win when every werewolf is dead
* The two lovebirds and cupid win when the two love birds are the last two people alive. (That means that both of them should work together to survive even when the love birds are on different teams.)
